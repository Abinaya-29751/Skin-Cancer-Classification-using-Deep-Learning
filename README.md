Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning
Implemented multi-class CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras to classify dermatological images into 7 skin cancer
categories. Processed HAM10000 dataset (10,015 samples) through deep convolutional layers with ReLU activation and
softmax classification. Built end-to-end ML pipeline with data normalization, feature extraction, pooling operations, and
categorical cross-entropy optimization for automated medical image classification.
### Tools and Techniques used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Computer Vision,
Medical AI, Data Preprocessing, NumPy, Pandas, Deep Learning, Image Classification, Healthcare Technology.
